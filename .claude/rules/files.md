# File Rules

1. **Blog Posts**:
   - MUST be created in `_posts/`.
   - MUST follow the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case-title.md`.

2. **Images**:
   - MUST be stored in `assets/img/`.
   - Should be referenced in posts using absolute paths like `/assets/img/filename.png` or relative paths if configured.

3. **General**:
   - Read `../../.gitignore` before creating files to avoid committing ignored artifacts.
   - If you significantly change the project structure, update `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the changes.
