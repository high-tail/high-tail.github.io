# Blog Writing Guide

This skill provides expert guidance for creating high-quality blog posts that match the project's specific requirements (Jekyll Chirpy theme).

## Core Requirements (MUST Follow)

1.  **File Naming**: Always use `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case-title.md` in `_posts/`.
2.  **Front Matter**: Every post must include `title`, `date`, `description`, `categories`, and `tags`.
3.  **Theme Features**: Use Chirpy's callouts (`{: .prompt-tip }`) and Mermaid support where appropriate.

## Blog Post Structure

A well-structured blog post follows this pattern (see `examples/blog-outline-template.md`):

1.  **Compelling Introduction**: Hook the reader and state the purpose.
2.  **Prerequisites/Context**: detailed environment or knowledge needed (use callouts).
3.  **Clear Main Body**: Logical sections with H2/H3 headings.
4.  **Actionable Conclusion**: Summary and next steps.
